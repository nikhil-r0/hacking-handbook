| -: | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
|  1 | `VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==` | **Base64 Decode:** The string format, use of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and `==` padding at the end are all strong indicators of Base64 encoding. Decoding it reveals the flag.                                                                             | `THM{ju57_d3c0d3_7h3_b453}`            |
|  2 | Image file                             | **Exiftool:** `exiftool` is a command-line tool used to read, write, and edit metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) in files. The flag was hidden within this metadata.                                                                                    | `THM{3x1f_0r_3x17}`                    |
|  3 | Image file                             | **Steghide:** Steganography tool. The command `steghide --extract -sf <image>` is used to extract data hidden within the image file itself, often protected by a passphrase (though not always).                                                | `THM{500n3r_0r_l473r_17_15_0ur_7urn}`  |
|  4 | Web page                               | **View Source:** The flag was hidden in the web page's HTML source code but not displayed on the page itself. This is often done by placing the flag inside an HTML comment (`<!-- ... -->`).                                                   | `THM{wh173_fl46}`                      |
|  5 | QR Code                                | **QR Code Scanner:** The challenge presented a QR code. Scanning it with any standard QR scanner app or online tool reveals the hidden text, which was the flag.                                                                                | `THM{qr_m4k3_l1f3_345y}`               |
|  6 | `hello` executable                     | **Strings:** The `strings` command extracts any printable text sequences from a binary file. This is useful for finding hardcoded flags or other interesting text in executables.                                                               | `THM{345y_f1nd_345y_60}`               |
|  7 | `3agrSy1...`                           | **Base58 Decode:** This encoding, similar to Base64, is common in cryptocurrency. It omits characters that look similar (like `0/O`, `I/l`) to avoid confusion.                                                                                 | `THM{17_h45_l3553r_l3773r5}`           |
|  8 | `MAF{atbe_max_vtxltk}`                 | **Caesar Cipher:** A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number. `MAF` shifts to `THM` with a +10 shift (or ROT10). Applying this to the rest gives the flag.                                                    | `THM{hail_the_caesar}`                 |
|  9 | Web page                               | **View Source (Comments):** Like challenge #4, the flag was explicitly hidden within an HTML comment in the page's source code.                                                                                                                 | `THM{4lw4y5_ch3ck_7h3_c0m3mn7}`        |
| 10 | Corrupted PNG                          | **Hex Editor (Magic Bytes):** The file was unreadable. Using a tool like `hexedit` or `HxD` to examine the file's bytes and correcting the header to the standard PNG "magic bytes" (`89 50 4E 47`) fixes the corruption.                       | `THM{y35_w3_c4n}`                      |
| 11 | Found on Reddit                        | **OSINT (Social Media):** Open-Source Intelligence. This challenge required searching public social media (Reddit) to find information or a post from a specific user that contained the flag.                                                  | `THM{50c14l_4cc0un7_15_p4r7_0f_051n7}` |
| 12 | `++++++++++[>+>...`                    | **Brainfuck:** This is an esoteric programming language. The code can be run using an online Brainfuck interpreter, which will execute the loops and print the flag to the output.                                                              | `THM{0h_my_h34d}`                      |
| 13 | S1: `445...` S2: `101...`              | **XOR:** The two hex strings were XORed together. S2 is just the hex value `10` repeated. XORing S1 with the repeating key `10` reveals the ASCII text of the flag.                                                                             | `THM{3xclu51v3_0r}`                    |
| 14 | Image file                             | **Binwalk:** `binwalk` is a tool for analyzing and extracting files embedded (hidden) inside other files. Running `binwalk -e <image>` scans the image and automatically carves out any hidden files, one of which held the flag.               | `THM{y0u_w4lk_m3_0u7}`                 |
| 15 | Image file                             | **Steganography (LSB):** Least Significant Bit steganography. The flag was hidden in the 2nd LSB (Least Significant Bit) of the image's pixel data. This requires a specialized stego tool to extract.                                          | `THM{7h3r3_15_h0p3_in_7h3_d4rkn355}`   |
| 16 | Audio file                             | **Audio Steganography (Spectrogram):** The flag was embedded in the audio. By opening the audio file in a tool like Audacity and viewing its spectrogram (a visual graph of frequencies), a QR code becomes visible, which can then be scanned. | `THM{SOUNDINGQR}`                      |
| 17 | Web page                               | **OSINT (Wayback Machine):** The flag wasn't on the current version of the web page. Using `web.archive.org` (the Wayback Machine) to view a historical snapshot of the site from a specific date revealed the flag.                            | `THM{ch3ck_th3_h4ckb4ck}`              |
| 18 | `MYKAHODTQ{...}`                       | **Vigenere Cipher:** A polyalphabetic cipher. Using the known plaintext `TRYHACKME` against its ciphertext `MYKAHODTQ` reveals the repeating key (`SHM`). This key can then be used to decrypt the rest of the flag.                            | `TRYHACKME{YOU_FOUND_THE_KEY}`         |
| 19 | `58169...933693`                       | **Base Conversion (Decimal to Hex):** The challenge provides a very large decimal (Base-10) number. Converting this number to hex (Base-16) results in a hex string which, when decoded from hex to ASCII, reveals the flag.                    | `THM{17_ju57_4n_0rd1n4ry_b4535}`       |
| 20 | `.pcapng` file                         | **Wireshark:** This is a network traffic capture file. Opening it in Wireshark and using the "Find Packet" (Ctrl+F) feature to search for the string `thm{` (as packet bytes) locates the flag within the data of a packet.                     | `THM{d0_n07_574lk_m3}`                 |
